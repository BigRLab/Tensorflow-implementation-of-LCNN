#  Light CNN for Deep Face Recognition, in Tensorflow
A Tensorflow implementation of [A Light CNN for Deep Face Representation with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02683) from the paper by Xiang Wu 

## Updates
- Sep 19, 2017
	- The repository was built.

## Datasets
- Download face dataset MS-Celeb-1M (Aligned Face images).
  - Download link: [MS-Celeb-1M (Aligned)](http://www.msceleb.org/download/aligned)
	- The MS-Celeb-1M clean list (10K identities) is uploaded: [One Drive](https://1drv.ms/t/s!AleP5K29t5x7ge87YS8Ue92h8JDDMw)
- All face images are RGB images and resize to **122x144** 
- Each image is padding 11 piex of left and right side and normlize to **144*144**
- The aligned LFW (122*144) images are uploaded on [One Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eR6vHFO).
